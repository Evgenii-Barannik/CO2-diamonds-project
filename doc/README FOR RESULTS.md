1. **edited-spectra** folder contains exported from Fityk spectra in .dat;
2. **spectra-plots** folder contains plots;

5. **matrix-not-used-for-plotting** folder also contains matrices created with the CO2D-MATRIX_EXPORT.lua script. Matrices from this folder are not used by the CO2D-MAPGEN.ipynb for map plotting;
6. **maps** folder contains maps created by the CO2D-MAPGEN.ipynb using matrices from the matrix folder;
7. **tables** folder contains tables with exported function parameters. Tables were created with the CO2D-TABLE_EXPORT.lua script.
